One of the most interesting aspects of Wavesfactory Samba Drums KONTAKT is that it is based on the samba de roda, a traditional style of samba that originated in the state of Bahia. Samba de roda is a circle dance that involves singing, clapping, dancing and playing instruments. It is considered one of the oldest forms of samba and a symbol of Afro-Brazilian culture. Samba de roda was recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2005.
 
Samba de roda is not the only type of samba that exists, however. Samba has evolved over time and has incorporated influences from other musical genres, such as jazz, rock, pop and funk. Some of the most popular sub-genres of samba are samba-canÃ§Ã£o (samba song), samba-choro (samba with choro elements), samba-jazz (samba with jazz elements), samba de breque (samba with spoken interjections), samba de enredo (samba with a theme for Carnaval), samba de exaltaÃ§Ã£o (samba with patriotic or optimistic lyrics), samba de partido-alto (samba with improvised verses), samba de terreiro (samba performed in the samba schools), samba-reggae (samba with reggae elements), samba duro (samba with a hard beat) and sambalanÃ§o (samba with a swing rhythm).
 
One of the most influential sub-genres of samba is bossa nova, which emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Bossa nova is a fusion of samba and jazz, characterized by a soft and smooth sound, complex harmonies and lyrical themes. Bossa nova was popularized by artists such as JoÃ£o Gilberto, AntÃ´nio Carlos Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes and Astrud Gilberto. Some of the most famous bossa nova songs are \"The Girl from Ipanema,\" \"Desafinado,\" \"Corcovado\" and \"Chega de Saudade.\" Bossa nova had a significant impact on the global music scene and influenced many other genres, such as pop, rock, soul and lounge.
